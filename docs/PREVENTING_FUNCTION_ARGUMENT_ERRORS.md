# Preventing Function Argument Errors

## Common Error Patterns

In our application, we've encountered several TypeScript errors related to function arguments and type mismatches. Here are the most common patterns and their solutions:

### 1. Incorrect Function Argument Count

**Error:** `Expected X arguments, but got Y`

**Root Cause:** 
These errors occur when a function is called with the wrong number of arguments, which happens when:
- API function signatures change
- Function overloads are misused
- Functions from multiple versions of an API are mixed

**Prevention:**
- Always check the function signature before calling it
- Use IDE hover functionality to verify required parameters
- When updating a function's signature, update all call sites

**Real-world Example:**
In accounting software like QuickBooks, incorrect parameter passing to invoice creation functions can lead to missing data fields or transaction errors.

### 2. Incompatible Type Assignment

**Error:** `Argument of type 'X' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Y'`

**Root Cause:**
These errors happen when we try to pass objects that are missing required properties or have properties of the wrong type.

**Prevention:**
- Use proper type annotations for all variables
- Create utility types like `Omit<>` and `Pick<>` to handle partial data
- Consider creating factory functions for complex objects

**Real-world Example:**
POS systems like Square require strict typing for payment processing functions to ensure transaction integrity.

### 3. Model vs. Entity Type Confusion

**Error:** `Property 'x' is missing in type 'Model' but required in type 'Entity'`

**Root Cause:**
Our app uses two different formats: snake_case for database entities and camelCase for UI models.

**Prevention:**
- Always use conversion functions at system boundaries
- Add explicit typing for all function parameters
- Document which functions expect models vs entities

**Real-world Example:**
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems like SAP maintain strict separation between UI models and database entities to prevent data corruption.

## Implementation Strategy

For our codebase, we will:

1. **Standardize Function Signatures:**
   - Document all service function signatures in a central location
   - Add JSDoc comments to all functions with parameter descriptions

2. **Create Type-Safe Wrappers:**
   - Use builder patterns for complex object creation
   - Add runtime validation for critical functions

3. **Implement Consistent Error Handling:**
   - Use Result types to handle errors predictably
   - Add logging for parameter validation failures

4. **Add Unit Tests:**
   - Test with invalid arguments to catch errors early
   - Verify type checking with TypeScript test runs

By following these practices, we'll reduce the occurrence of function argument errors and improve code quality.
