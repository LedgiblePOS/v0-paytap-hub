# TypeScript Error Fixes Documentation

This document summarizes the common TypeScript errors encountered in the project and the solutions implemented to fix them.

## Common Error Patterns

1. **Missing Exports in Service Files**
   - Error: `Module X has no exported member Y`
   - Solution: Add the missing exports to the service files

2. **Entity/Model Type Mismatches**
   - Error: Property names don't match between snake_case (entity) and camelCase (model)
   - Solution: Use proper conversion between entity and model types

3. **JSON Type Safety Issues**
   - Error: Property access on `Json` type which could be string/number/object/array
   - Solution: Add type checking before accessing properties

4. **Enum Type Assignment**
   - Error: String literals not being recognized as valid enum values
   - Solution: Use the actual enum instead of string literals

5. **Import Issues**
   - Error: `Module X has no default export`
   - Solution: Use named imports instead of default imports

6. **Missing Methods in Services**
   - Error: `Property 'X' does not exist on type 'Service'`
   - Solution: Implement the missing method in the service following the getter/setter pattern

## Specific Fixes

### Service Files

1. **checkoutService.ts**
   - Added missing `isBridgeEnabled()` method to match the `toggleBridgeMode()` method
   - Ensured getter/setter pattern consistency across the service
   - Added proper JSDoc comments and return type annotations

2. **settingsManager.ts**
   - Verified correct implementation of `isBridgeEnabled()` method
   - Ensured proper data flow between service layers

3. **dashboardService.ts**
   - Added missing exports: `fetchMerchantData`, `fetchRecentTransactions`, `generateWeeklyRevenue`
   - Fixed enum type issue by using `SubscriptionTier.GO_GLOBAL` instead of string literal

4. **analyticsService.ts**
   - Added missing functions: `getSalesByTimePeriod`, `getTopSellingProducts`, `getCustomerInsights`
   - Fixed entity/model conversion with proper property naming

5. **verificationService.ts**
   - Added missing exports: `getPendingVerifications`, `approveVerification`, `rejectVerification`
   - Improved JSON handling with type checking

## Best Practices

1. **API Consistency**: Follow a consistent pattern for method naming:
   - Getters: `isEnabled()`, `getStatus()`, `hasPermission()`
   - Setters: `setEnabled()`, `updateStatus()`, `grantPermission()`
   - Toggles: `toggleFeature()` should always have a corresponding `isFeatureEnabled()`

2. **Method Implementation**: Always implement both getters and setters for properties
   - Every setter should have a corresponding getter
   - Every toggle should have a corresponding checker

3. **Documentation**: Use JSDoc comments for all service methods
   - Document parameters and return types
   - Include usage examples for complex methods

4. **Interface Definitions**: Create explicit interfaces for all services to ensure implementation consistency

By following these patterns, we can prevent similar TypeScript errors in future builds.
