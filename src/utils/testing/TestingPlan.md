## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to track completion of testing activities:

- [ ] Authentication flows verified
- [ ] Role-based access controls confirmed
- [ ] Navigation between all pages tested
- [ ] Form validations checked
- [ ] CRUD operations verified for all entities
- [ ] Responsive design confirmed across breakpoints
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Analytics data accuracy verified
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Performance benchmarking completed

## Test Environment Setup

1. Use browser dev tools to test responsive layouts
2. Create test accounts with different roles for testing access controls
3. Use network throttling to test slow connection scenarios
4. Test with both sample and real production-like data volumes
5. Verify in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting issues, include:
- Detailed steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots/videos if applicable
- Browser and device information
- Relevant error messages from console

This structured testing approach will ensure the application is thoroughly vetted before production deployment.
