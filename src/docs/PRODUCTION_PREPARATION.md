# Production Preparation Plan

This document outlines our strategy for preparing the application for production deployment, focusing on authentication/authorization and module implementation prioritization.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization Strategy

### Current State
- Authentication system: Implemented with Supabase
- User roles: MERCHANT and SUPER_ADMIN defined in UserRole enum
- Role-based access control: Implemented through ProtectedRoute components

### Production Readiness Tasks
- [ ] Complete comprehensive testing of login flow with error handling
- [ ] Ensure registration flow properly creates user profiles
- [ ] Verify all protected routes enforce proper role-based access
- [ ] Implement session timeout handling
- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [ ] Create authentication error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Document authentication flow for future developers

### Authentication Best Practices
1. **User Session Management**
   - Always maintain complete session objects, not just user data
   - Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
   - Handle authentication state changes consistently

2. **Security Measures**
   - Enforce password strength requirements
   - Implement rate limiting for login attempts
   - Ensure proper CORS configuration in production

3. **Error Handling**
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Log authentication failures for security monitoring
   - Implement graceful recovery from authentication errors

## 2. Module Implementation Priority

### Core Module Development Order
1. Dashboard (central navigation hub)
2. Inventory Management (product catalog foundation)
3. Products (building on inventory data)
4. Customers
5. POS/Sales
6. Payments
7. Analytics
8. Settings
9. Extended features (Tax Reporting, Sales Projections)

### Module Development Process
Each module will follow this standardized development process:

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define clear module boundaries and interfaces
   - Identify data requirements and dependencies
   - Create wireframes/mockups for UI components

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Create module-specific components in dedicated directories
   - Implement data fetching with proper loading/error states
   - Build UI components following design system guidelines

3. **Integration Phase**
   - Connect module to global state management
   - Ensure proper routing and navigation
   - Implement role-based access control for module features

4. **Testing Phase**
   - Unit test critical module functions
   - Integration test with dependent modules
   - User acceptance testing with representative scenarios

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document module structure and key components
   - Add inline code comments for complex logic
   - Update this production preparation document

### Module Implementation Best Practices
1. **Component Structure**
   - Create small, focused components (â‰¤ 100 lines)
   - Separate business logic from UI components
   - Use consistent naming conventions

2. **State Management**
   - Clearly define module-specific state
   - Use React Query for server state
   - Implement optimistic updates where appropriate

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add error boundaries around module components
   - Implement proper loading states with timeouts
   - Provide fallback UI for error scenarios

## Implementation Checklist

### Priority 1: Authentication Hardening
- [ ] Complete authentication flow testing
- [ ] Fix any identified authentication issues
- [ ] Document authentication system

### Priority 2: Core Module Implementation
- [ ] Complete Dashboard module
- [ ] Complete Inventory module
- [ ] Integrate Products with Inventory

### Priority 3: Secondary Module Implementation
- [ ] Complete remaining modules following priority order
- [ ] Ensure consistent UI/UX across all modules
- [ ] Verify role-based access control for all features

## Conclusion

By following this structured approach to production preparation, we'll ensure a robust, maintainable application that can be confidently deployed to production environments.
