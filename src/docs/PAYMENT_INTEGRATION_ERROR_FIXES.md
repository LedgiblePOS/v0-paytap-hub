# Payment Integration Error Fixes

## Issue: Type Mismatch in usePaymentIntegration Hook

### Problem Description

The First Atlantic Commerce integration was causing TypeScript errors due to a mismatch between the hook API being used in components and what the hook was actually returning:

```
Property 'credentials' does not exist on type '{ isLoading: boolean; error: string; ... }'.
Property 'setCredentials' does not exist on type '{ isLoading: boolean; error: string; ... }'.
Property 'isSaving' does not exist on type '{ isLoading: boolean; error: string; ... }'.
Property 'credentialsLoaded' does not exist on type '{ isLoading: boolean; error: string; ... }'.
Property 'handleInputChange' does not exist on type '{ isLoading: boolean; error: string; ... }'.
Property 'saveCredentials' does not exist on type '{ isLoading: boolean; error: string; ... }'.
```

These errors occurred because the component was trying to destructure properties that weren't being returned by the hook.

### Root Causes

1. **API Mismatch**: The `usePaymentIntegration` hook did not return all the properties that the `FirstAtlanticCommerceSettings` component expected.

2. **Incomplete Implementation**: The hook was initially designed for general payment settings but needed specific functionality for First Atlantic Commerce credentials.

3. **Type Definition Issues**: The hook's return type didn't match its actual returned object structure.

### Solution

The solution involved refactoring the `usePaymentIntegration` hook to:

1. Add the missing state variables and functions:
   - `credentials` and `setCredentials` for form state
   - `isSaving` to track save operations
   - `credentialsLoaded` to indicate when credentials have been fetched
   - `handleInputChange` for form field updates
   - `saveCredentials` to persist the updated credentials

2. Ensure the return object includes all properties needed by the component:
```typescript
return {
  isLoading,
  isSaving,
  error,
  settings,
  credentials,
  setCredentials,
  credentialsLoaded,
  handleInputChange,
  saveCredentials,
  refreshSettings: fetchPaymentSettings
};
```

3. Add proper TypeScript types to prevent deep instantiation issues.

## Best Practices for Hook API Design

1. **Consistent API Design**: Ensure hooks return consistent objects that match what components expect.

2. **Type Safety**: Define explicit interfaces for hook return types and state variables.

3. **Error Handling**: Include proper error states and messaging in hooks.

4. **Loading States**: Track loading and saving operations separately.

5. **Documentation**: Document the expected input and output of hooks.

6. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep hooks focused on specific functionality.

## Workflow Improvements

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Type-First Development**: Define interfaces before implementing hooks and components.

2. **Component-Hook Contract**: Document the expected API between components and their hooks.

3. **Unit Testing**: Write tests to verify hooks return the expected properties.

4. **Code Reviews**: Specifically check for API consistency between hooks and components.

5. **Pull Request Templates**: Include a checklist for type safety and API consistency.
