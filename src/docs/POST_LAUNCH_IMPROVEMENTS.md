## Continuous Improvement Process

To ensure ongoing quality improvement after launch:

1. **Feedback Collection**:
   - In-app feedback mechanism for users
   - Regular customer success check-ins
   - Monitoring of support tickets for common issues

2. **Prioritization Process**:
   - Weekly triage of new feedback items
   - Monthly prioritization meeting with stakeholders
   - Quarterly roadmap adjustment based on feedback trends

3. **Communication Plan**:
   - Release notes for each version
   - Advance notification for significant changes
   - Regular status updates to stakeholders

## Success Metrics

To measure the effectiveness of our post-launch improvements:

1. User satisfaction ratings (target: 8.5/10 or higher)
2. Feature adoption rates for new capabilities
3. Support ticket volume (target: 20% reduction by v1.3)
4. System performance metrics (target: 99.9% uptime, sub-2s response times)

## Next Steps

1. Finalize v1.1 scope and timeline
2. Create detailed specifications for prioritized improvements
3. Set up automated collection of user feedback
4. Establish regular review cadence for improvement metrics
