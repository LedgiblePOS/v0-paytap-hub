## Error Encountered 

```
[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "chart.js" from "src/components/ui/chart.tsx".
```

This error occurred because the project was trying to use Chart.js and React-ChartJS-2 libraries, but they weren't installed as dependencies in the project.

## Resolution Steps

1. **Added Missing Dependencies**:
   - Installed `chart.js` package (v4.4.2)
   - Installed `react-chartjs-2` package (v5.2.0)

2. **Updated Chart Component**:
   - Updated imports to use the correct paths and types
   - Added explicit type definitions for chart props
   - Renamed Chart to ReactChart to avoid naming collisions
   - Added additional utility components (ChartContainer, ChartTooltipContent)

3. **Updated Component Usage**:
   - Made sure components using charts were updated to use the new API

## Best Practices for Chart.js Integration

### 1. Dependency Management
- Always include chart.js and react-chartjs-2 as explicit dependencies
- Ensure version compatibility between these packages

### 2. Component Architecture
- Create reusable chart components with proper TypeScript typing
- Provide sensible defaults for chart options
- Allow customization through props

### 3. Consistent Styling
- Use a consistent color palette for data visualization
- Define theme-aware colors when possible
- Use responsive options for different screen sizes

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Only register necessary Chart.js components
- Consider lazy-loading chart components for performance
- Memoize chart data calculations if they're expensive

### 5. Accessibility
- Include proper aria labels
- Provide alternative text descriptions for complex charts
- Consider color contrast for accessibility

## Chart Components Available

The chart.tsx file now provides these reusable components:

1. `LineChart` - For time series and trend data
2. `BarChart` - For comparing discrete categories
3. `PieChart` - For showing proportions of a whole
4. `DoughnutChart` - Similar to pie charts but with a center hole
5. `ChartContainer` - Wrapper component for consistent styling
6. `ChartTooltipContent` - Custom tooltip component for data points

Each component is fully typed with TypeScript to provide proper intellisense and type-checking.
