# Recent Errors and Fixes

This document tracks recent errors encountered in the Ledgible application and how they were resolved.

## Import Path Error

**Error:**
```
src/components/Routes/MerchantRoutes.tsx(6,23): error TS2307: Cannot find module '@/pages/Merchant/Dashboard' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

**Root Cause:**
Incorrect import path for the Dashboard component in MerchantRoutes.tsx.

**Fix:**
Updated the import path to use the correct location of the Dashboard component:
```tsx
// Changed from:
import Dashboard from '@/pages/Merchant/Dashboard';

// To:
import Dashboard from '@/pages/Dashboard/Index';
```

## React Hook Error

**Error:**
```
Component Error: There was an error rendering this component: Error Information
Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.
```

**Root Cause:**
The useAuth hook was being called directly inside a useEffect dependency array, outside the body of the function component.

**Fix:**
Moved the useAuth hook call to the component body and used its result in the useEffect dependency array:

```tsx
// Changed from:
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("User is authenticated:", useAuth().user?.role);
}, []);

// To:
const { user } = useAuth();
  
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("User is authenticated:", user?.role);
}, [user]);
```

## White Page Issues

**Error:**
Blank/white pages appearing in merchant module routes.

**Root Cause:**
Multiple factors:
1. Missing proper content detection
2. No fallback UI for routes still in development
3. Insufficient error boundaries
4. Race conditions in component rendering

**Fix:**
1. Added MerchantModulePlaceholder component for routes still in development
2. Enhanced error boundaries around all routes
3. Added route content validation and debugging tools
4. Implemented better loading and error states

## Content Detection Issues

**Error:**
Route validation warning in console:
```
[RouteValidator] Dashboard validation: {
  "isValid": false,
  "pageName": "Dashboard",
  "details": "Missing content for Dashboard. Expected any of: [data-testid=\"dashboard-content\"], .dashboard-stats, .dashboard-charts, .merchant-overview"
}
```

**Root Cause:**
Dashboard component doesn't have the expected data-testid or class selectors that the route validator is looking for.

**Status:**
Currently being monitored. The page renders but doesn't pass the validation check. This is a non-critical issue since content is still visible to users.

## TypeScript Return Type Error

**Error:**
```
src/utils/routeContentValidator.ts(137,3): error TS2322: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'void'.
```

**Root Cause:**
The `logRouteDebugInfo` function was incorrectly returning a boolean value but was declared to return `void`.

**Fix:**
Removed the implicit return statement at the end of the function to ensure it correctly returns `void` as specified in its signature.

## Next Steps for Resolution

1. Add appropriate data-testid attributes to the Dashboard component
2. Ensure all new merchant modules use consistent naming for content elements
3. Update routeContentValidator.ts with actual selectors used in components
