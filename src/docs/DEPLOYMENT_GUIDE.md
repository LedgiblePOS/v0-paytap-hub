# Deployment Guide

This document outlines the process for deploying the application to various environments.

## Deployment Environments

The application supports three deployment environments:

1. **Development**: For active development and testing
2. **Staging**: For pre-production verification
3. **Production**: For end-user access

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. Access to the target environment
2. Required environment variables set
3. Database migrations prepared
4. Appropriate permissions for deployment

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured for proper operation:

```
# Core Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com

# Authentication
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
VITE_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

# Third-Party Services
VITE_PAYMENT_GATEWAY_URL=https://payment.example.com
VITE_PAYMENT_API_KEY=your-payment-key
```

## Build Process

To create a production build:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm ci
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

3. The built files will be in the `dist` directory

## Deployment Steps

### Deploying to Development

1. Push code to the development branch
2. CI pipeline will automatically deploy to development environment
3. Access at https://dev.example.com

### Deploying to Staging

1. Create a release branch from main
2. Run the staging deployment pipeline:
   ```
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```
3. Access at https://staging.example.com
4. Run integration tests:
   ```
   npm run test:integration
   ```

### Deploying to Production

1. Merge the release branch to main
2. Tag the release:
   ```
   git tag v1.x.x
   git push --tags
   ```
3. Run the production deployment pipeline:
   ```
   npm run deploy:production
   ```
4. Verify deployment at https://example.com

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected in production:

1. Identify the last stable version tag
2. Trigger the rollback pipeline:
   ```
   npm run rollback --version=v1.x.x
   ```
3. Verify the rollback was successful

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, perform these verification steps:

1. Test critical user flows
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check for any console errors
4. Verify authentication flows
5. Test payment processing

## Monitoring Deployed Application

1. Access application logs:
   ```
   npm run logs:production
   ```

2. Monitor error rates and performance:
   - Access the monitoring dashboard at https://monitoring.example.com
   - Check for unexpected error patterns
   - Verify performance metrics are within expected ranges

3. Set up alerts for critical issues:
   ```
   npm run alerts:setup --env=production
   ```

## Database Migrations

When deploying schema changes:

1. Review migration files
2. Test migrations on staging first:
   ```
   npm run db:migrate --env=staging
   ```
3. Apply to production during deployment:
   ```
   npm run db:migrate --env=production
   ```
4. Verify data integrity after migration

## Security Considerations

1. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure valid SSL certificate is installed
2. **API Rate Limiting**: Verify rate limiting is active
3. **Authentication**: Test all authentication flows
4. **Permissions**: Verify role-based access controls

## Continuous Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

1. Server health metrics
2. API response times
3. Error rates
4. User activity

## Emergency Contacts

If critical issues arise during deployment:

- Primary Contact: devops@example.com
- Secondary Contact: engineering-lead@example.com
- Escalation: cto@example.com

## Compliance Verification

Ensure these compliance checks are completed:

1. Accessibility standards met
2. GDPR compliance verified
3. Security practices followed
4. Data handling procedures verified

This guide should be updated when deployment processes change.
