# CI/CD Pipeline Guide

This document provides detailed information about our Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Pipeline Architecture

Our CI/CD pipeline is built on GitHub Actions and consists of the following stages:

```
[ Code Push ] → [ Install ] → [ Lint & Type Check ] → [ Test ] → [ Build ] → [ Deploy ]
```

## Pipeline Configuration

The pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` with the following key stages:

### 1. Install Dependencies

This stage installs all dependencies needed for the application:

```yaml
install:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
        cache: 'npm'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Cache node modules
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: node_modules
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

### 2. Code Quality Checks

This stage performs static code analysis:

```yaml
type-check:
  needs: install
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
        cache: 'npm'
    - name: Restore cache
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: node_modules
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    - name: Run TypeScript checks
      run: npx tsc --noEmit

lint:
  needs: install
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
        cache: 'npm'
    - name: Restore cache
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: node_modules
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint
```

### 3. Automated Testing

This stage runs all automated tests:

```yaml
test:
  needs: install
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
        cache: 'npm'
    - name: Restore cache
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: node_modules
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

### 4. Build Process

This stage creates production-ready builds:

```yaml
build:
  needs: [lint, test, type-check]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
        cache: 'npm'
    - name: Restore cache
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: node_modules
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build
    - name: Upload build artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build-files
        path: dist
```

### 5. Deployment

This stage deploys to production environments:

```yaml
deploy:
  needs: build
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Download build artifacts
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build-files
        path: dist
    - name: Deploy to production
      # Deployment steps (cloud provider specific)
```

## Environment-Specific Workflows

### Development Environment

- Triggered on: Every push to any branch
- Skips deployment step
- Runs: Install, Type Check, Lint, Test, Build

### Staging Environment

- Triggered on: Pull request to `main` branch
- Runs full pipeline
- Deploys to staging environment for verification

### Production Environment

- Triggered on: Push to `main` branch
- Runs full pipeline with additional security checks
- Deploys to production environment after approval

## Environment Variables

### Managing Environment Variables

We use environment-specific variable sets in GitHub Actions:

1. **Development Variables**:
   - Used during development and testing

2. **Staging Variables**:
   - Used for pre-production verification

3. **Production Variables**:
   - Used in production deployment
   - Requires additional access permissions

### Sensitive Information

Sensitive environment variables are stored as GitHub secrets:

- API keys
- Authentication tokens
- Database credentials
- External service credentials

## Deployment Strategy

### Deployment Process

Our deployment follows these steps:

1. **Environment Preparation**:
   - Set environment variables
   - Prepare infrastructure (if needed)

2. **Artifact Deployment**:
   - Upload build artifacts
   - Configure caching and CDN

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**:
   - Run health checks
   - Monitor for errors

### Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment issues:

1. **Automatic Rollback Triggers**:
   - Health check failures
   - High error rates (>5%)

2. **Manual Rollback**:
   - Use the rollback command:
     ```bash
     npm run rollback --version=v1.2.3
     ```

## Local Testing

To run the CI pipeline locally before pushing:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run TypeScript, ESLint, and Jest tests
npm run ci-check

# Build the application
npm run build
```

## Custom Scripts

Special npm scripts for CI/CD workflow:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "ci-check": "npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm test",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "build:production": "vite build --mode production"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep builds fast**: Optimize test suites and build processes
2. **Fail early**: Run fastest checks first (lint, then type checks)
3. **Automate everything**: Minimize manual steps in deployment
4. **Version artifacts**: Tag and version all deployments
5. **Monitor deployments**: Set up alerts for deployment failures

This CI/CD pipeline ensures consistent, reliable, and automated delivery of our application while maintaining high quality standards.
