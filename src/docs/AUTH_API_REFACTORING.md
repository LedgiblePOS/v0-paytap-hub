# Authentication API Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring of our authentication API to improve code organization, maintainability, and readability.

## Refactoring Strategy

We've broken down the monolithic `authApi.ts` file into smaller, focused modules:

1. **userDataService.ts** - Handles user profile data operations
   - `getUserData` - Fetches and formats user profile data
   - `updateUserProfileData` - Updates user profile information

2. **authenticationService.ts** - Manages authentication operations
   - `loginUser` - Handles user login with security features
   - `logoutUser` - Manages secure logout
   - `registerUser` - Processes user registration with validation

3. **permissionService.ts** - Manages authorization and permissions
   - `checkPermission` - Validates user roles and permissions
   - `checkMerchantOnboarding` - Verifies merchant profile completion
   - `updateUserRole` - Handles role changes with audit logging

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each service module now focuses on a specific aspect of authentication, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### 2. Improved Error Handling
Each module implements consistent error handling patterns with specific error types for different scenarios.

### 3. Better Type Safety
TypeScript types are properly enforced throughout the modules, reducing the risk of type-related errors.

### 4. Enhanced Security Features
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Strong password validation
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Usage Guidelines

When working with the authentication API:

1. Import specific functions from the central `authApi.ts` file, which re-exports all functionality.
2. Use the appropriate service based on the operation you need to perform.
3. Handle errors properly by checking for specific error types.

Example:
```typescript
import { loginUser, checkPermission } from '@/contexts/auth/authApi';

// Authentication
try {
  const userData = await loginUser(email, password);
  // Handle successful login
} catch (error) {
  // Handle login error
}

// Permission check
if (checkPermission(user, [UserRole.SUPER_ADMIN])) {
  // Allow access to admin features
}
```

## Future Improvements

- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed user data
- Add support for additional authentication methods (OAuth, SSO)
- Implement more granular permission controls based on resource types
