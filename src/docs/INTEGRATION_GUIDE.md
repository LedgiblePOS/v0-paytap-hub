# Integration Guide

This document provides comprehensive instructions for integrating with our system APIs, webhooks, and external services.

## Authentication Methods

### API Key Authentication

For server-to-server integrations, use API key authentication:

1. Generate an API key in your account dashboard
2. Include the key in the request header:
   ```
   X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
   ```

### OAuth 2.0 Authentication

For applications acting on behalf of users:

1. Register your application in our developer portal
2. Implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow:
   - Authorization Code Flow (for web applications)
   - PKCE Flow (for mobile applications)
   - Client Credentials Flow (for secure backend services)

3. Example OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request:
   ```
   GET https://api.example.com/oauth/authorize
   ?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
   &redirect_uri=https://your-app.com/callback
   &response_type=code
   &scope=read write
   &state=random_state_string
   ```

## API Integration Best Practices

### Rate Limiting

Our APIs implement rate limiting to ensure fair usage:
- Default limit: 100 requests per minute
- Bulk endpoints: 10 requests per minute
- Response headers indicate your current rate limit status

### Error Handling

Implement proper error handling for API responses:
- 4xx errors: Client-side issues (invalid parameters, authentication)
- 5xx errors: Server-side issues (service unavailable)
- Always check error response bodies for detailed information

### Pagination

For endpoints returning large collections:
- Use the `page` and `limit` parameters
- Follow the `next` and `prev` links in the response
- Implement cursor-based pagination for real-time data

## Webhook Integration

### Setting Up Webhooks

1. Navigate to Developer Settings > Webhooks
2. Configure a webhook endpoint URL
3. Select events to subscribe to
4. Generate a webhook signing secret
5. Test the webhook configuration

### Webhook Verification

Verify webhook authenticity by validating the signature:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  const digest = hmac.update(payload).digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(digest),
    Buffer.from(signature)
  );
}
```

### Handling Webhook Events

1. Parse the incoming webhook payload
2. Verify the webhook signature
3. Process based on the event type
4. Return a 200 OK response promptly
5. Process complex logic asynchronously

## Common Integration Scenarios

### E-commerce Platform Integration

Connect your e-commerce platform to synchronize:
- Products and inventory
- Orders and fulfillment status
- Customer data
- Pricing and promotions

Implementation steps:
1. Configure API authentication
2. Set up initial product sync
3. Configure real-time order webhooks
4. Implement inventory updates
5. Test end-to-end order flow

### Accounting Software Integration

Integrate with accounting systems for:
- Invoice generation
- Payment reconciliation
- Financial reporting

Implementation steps:
1. Map product categories to accounting codes
2. Configure daily transaction synchronization
3. Set up automatic invoice generation
4. Implement payment matching logic

### CRM Integration

Connect customer relationship management systems:
- Customer profile synchronization
- Purchase history tracking
- Support ticket integration

Implementation steps:
1. Set up bi-directional contact sync
2. Configure order history updates
3. Implement customer segment tagging
4. Enable support context sharing

## Testing Your Integration

### Sandbox Environment

Use our sandbox environment for testing:
- Base URL: https://api-sandbox.example.com
- Separate API credentials required
- Test data provided
- Simulated responses for payment processing

### Integration Testing Tools

Recommended tools for testing:
- API clients: Postman, Insomnia
- Webhook testing: ngrok, RequestBin
- Automated testing: Jest, Mocha, Cypress

### Common Testing Scenarios

1. **Authentication Flow Testing**
   - Verify token acquisition
   - Test token refresh
   - Validate expired token handling

2. **Data Synchronization Testing**
   - Create, update, and delete operations
   - Large dataset handling
   - Conflict resolution

3. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Invalid requests
   - Rate limiting scenarios
   - Service outage recovery

## Going Live Checklist

Before moving to production:
- [ ] Switch to production API endpoints
- [ ] Update to production API credentials
- [ ] Set up monitoring for API usage
- [ ] Configure alert thresholds
- [ ] Document integration touchpoints
- [ ] Create rollback plan for issues
- [ ] Set up error logging
- [ ] Test critical paths in production

## Changelog and Versioning

Our API follows semantic versioning:
- Major versions may contain breaking changes
- Minor versions add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- Patch versions include backward-compatible bug fixes

We maintain:
- Change logs for each version
- Deprecation notices at least 6 months in advance
- Multiple supported versions simultaneously
