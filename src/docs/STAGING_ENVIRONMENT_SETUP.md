# Staging Environment Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up and managing the staging environment, which mirrors the production environment for testing and validation purposes.

## Overview

The staging environment is designed to be an exact replica of the production environment, allowing for thorough testing of new features, bug fixes, and configuration changes before they're deployed to production.

## Environment Configuration

### Infrastructure Setup

1. **Server Configuration**

   The staging server should match production specifications:
   
   ```
   - Instance Type: Similar to production (can be slightly scaled down)
   - OS: Same as production
   - Network Configuration: Similar security groups and access controls
   - Database: Separate instance with identical schema
   ```

2. **Domain Configuration**

   ```
   - Primary Domain: staging.example.com
   - SSL Certificate: Valid SSL certificate for the staging domain
   - DNS Configuration: A record pointing to the staging server IP
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env.staging` file with the following variables:
   
   ```
   VITE_APP_ENV=staging
   VITE_API_URL=https://staging-api.example.com
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://staging-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-staging-anon-key
   VITE_LOG_LEVEL=info
   VITE_FEATURE_NEW_DASHBOARD=true
   VITE_FEATURE_ADVANCED_ANALYTICS=true
   VITE_FEATURE_BETA_FEATURES=true
   ```

### Database Configuration

1. **Database Setup**

   Create a separate database instance for staging with the same schema as production:
   
   ```
   - Database Type: Same as production
   - Version: Same as production
   - Schema: Identical to production
   - Extensions: Same as production
   ```

2. **Test Data**

   Populate the staging database with:
   
   - Anonymized production data (when possible)
   - Test accounts for QA purposes
   - Sample data covering edge cases

3. **Backup Strategy**

   Configure automated backups:
   
   ```
   - Frequency: Daily
   - Retention: 7 days
   - Restoration Process: Documented and tested
   ```

## Deployment Process

### Continuous Integration

Set up a CI/CD pipeline for the staging environment:

1. **Build Process**

   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run build:staging
   ```

2. **Deployment Process**

   ```bash
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```

3. **Automated Tests**

   Run after each deployment:
   
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:staging
   ```

### Manual Deployment

If needed, manual deployment can be performed:

1. Build the application:

   ```bash
   npm run build -- --mode staging
   ```

2. Deploy using the deployment script:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```

## Testing Procedures

### Pre-Deployment Testing

Before deploying to staging:

1. Run unit and integration tests
2. Perform code reviews
3. Complete static code analysis

### Post-Deployment Testing

After deploying to staging:

1. Run smoke tests to verify basic functionality
2. Execute end-to-end test suites
3. Perform manual testing of critical paths
4. Conduct security scans and assessments

### User Acceptance Testing

For major releases:

1. Invite stakeholders to test on staging
2. Document feedback and issues
3. Address critical issues before production deployment

## Monitoring and Logs

### Monitoring Setup

Configure the following monitoring tools:

1. **Application Performance Monitoring**
   - Set up APM tools with the same configuration as production
   - Configure alerts for critical performance issues

2. **Error Tracking**
   - Set up error logging with the same tools as production
   - Ensure proper tagging of environments to differentiate staging and production errors

3. **Uptime Monitoring**
   - Configure uptime checks for key endpoints
   - Set up notifications for downtime

### Log Management

Configure logging:

1. **Log Levels**
   - Set to `info` level for more detailed debugging compared to production

2. **Log Retention**
   - Keep logs for 14 days for debugging purposes

3. **Log Access**
   - Provide access to development and QA teams

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

1. **Environment Access**
   - Restrict access to development and QA teams
   - Implement IP whitelisting when possible

2. **Authentication**
   - Use test accounts with documented credentials
   - Do not store production credentials in staging

3. **Sensitive Data**
   - Anonymize or obfuscate sensitive customer data
   - Use test payment processing systems, not live payment processors

## Feedback and Issue Reporting

### Bug Tracking

1. Set up a dedicated project or label in the issue tracking system for staging issues
2. Document steps to reproduce, expected results, and actual results
3. Include environment information with each report

### Feature Validation

1. Create a feature validation checklist for each new feature
2. Document expected behavior and test cases
3. Provide feedback through established channels

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Process

If issues are detected in staging:

1. Identify the source of the issue
2. Revert to the previous stable version if needed
3. Document the issue and fix in the tracking system
4. Re-deploy when fixed

### Recovery Time Objectives

- Staging environment should be restored within 1 hour of critical issues
- Database rollbacks should be completed within 30 minutes

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Staging Current**
   - Regularly sync staging with production configuration
   - Update test data periodically to reflect production patterns

2. **Test in Isolation**
   - Avoid making multiple significant changes at once
   - Allow adequate time for testing between deployments

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep deployment and configuration documentation up-to-date
   - Document all known differences between staging and production

4. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Schedule regular maintenance windows
   - Clean up test data periodically
   - Update dependencies in line with production

By following this guide, you'll maintain a robust staging environment that effectively mirrors production, allowing for thorough testing and validation before production deployment.
