# Accounting & Inventory Integration: Error Prevention Guide

## Common Error Patterns Fixed

In this update, we fixed several TypeScript errors and integrated inventory reordering with the accounting system. The main issues addressed were:

1. **Incorrect Import Paths**: 
   - Imported from 'next/router' instead of 'react-router-dom'
   - Fixed by using the correct router implementation for our project

2. **Component Type Mismatches**:
   - Sidebar.Item was being referenced while the actual component is Sidebar.NavItem
   - Fixed by updating component references to use the correct components

3. **Missing Type Imports**:
   - ExpenseModel and IncomeModel were not imported in useAccounting.ts
   - Fixed by importing necessary types from '@/types/accounting'

4. **Incorrect Function Signatures**:
   - API calls had incorrect parameters count
   - Fixed by checking the service implementations and updating argument counts

5. **Missing QueryClient Context**:
   - useQueryClient was used but not imported
   - Fixed by correctly importing from @tanstack/react-query

## Best Practices for Preventing These Errors

Following the TypeScript error prevention guidelines from our documentation:

1. **Entity/Model Type Pattern**:
   - Always explicitly import types from their source files
   - Use the appropriate entity or model type based on context

2. **Boundary Conversions**:
   - Ensure proper conversion between database entities and UI models
   - Convert at the boundary between database and UI layers

3. **Component References**:
   - Reference components using their exact exported names
   - Check component documentation or definitions when unsure about props

4. **API Function Calls**:
   - Check service implementation before calling functions
   - Ensure function parameters match the implementation

5. **React Query Usage**:
   - Always import useQueryClient from @tanstack/react-query
   - Follow the object pattern for configuring queries

## Inventory-Accounting Integration Implementation

We implemented a system for inventory reordering that integrates with the accounting system:

1. **Supplier Service**:
   - Created a supplier service to manage supplier data
   - Implemented functions to get supplier information

2. **Reorder Expense Creation**:
   - Added functionality to record inventory reorders as expenses
   - Used the existing accounting system to track these expenses

3. **Reorder UI Components**:
   - Enhanced ReorderRecommendations to show low stock items
   - Created a ReorderForm component for submitting reorders

4. **Integration Flow**:
   1. User identifies low stock items through the inventory system
   2. User selects items to reorder from a supplier
   3. System calculates total cost and creates an expense record
   4. Expense is tracked in the accounting system with proper categorization

This integration follows our best practices:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Type safety throughout the system
- Reuse of existing accounting functionality
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Automatic reorder triggering based on inventory levels
- Integration with real supplier APIs
- Tracking of order fulfillment status
- Receipt attachment for reorder expenses
- Historical reorder analysis
