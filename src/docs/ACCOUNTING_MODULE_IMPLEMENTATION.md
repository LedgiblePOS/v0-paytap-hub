# Accounting Module Implementation

## Overview

The Accounting module provides merchants with essential financial tracking and reporting capabilities. This module integrates with the existing Inventory and POS systems to provide a comprehensive financial management solution.

## Module Architecture

The Accounting module follows our established architectural patterns:

### 1. Page Layer
- `pages/Accounting/Index.tsx` - Main entry point that renders the accounting dashboard
- Manages high-level state and module coordination

### 2. Component Layer
- `AccountingTabs.tsx` - Navigation component for different accounting sections
- `AccountingOverview.tsx` - Summary dashboard with key financial metrics
- `ExpensesList.tsx` - Component for managing business expenses
- `IncomeList.tsx` - Component for tracking all income sources
- `ReceiptScanner.tsx` - Tool for digitizing and tracking receipts
- `TaxReporting.tsx` - Interface for tax compliance and reporting

### 3. Hook Layer
- `useAccounting.ts` - Main hook that coordinates all accounting functionality
- `useExpenses.ts` - Hook specifically for expense management
- `useIncomes.ts` - Hook for income tracking
- `useFinancialReporting.ts` - Hook for generating reports and summaries

### 4. Service Layer
- `expenseService.ts` - API functions for CRUD operations on expenses
- `incomeService.ts` - API functions for income-related operations
- `reportingService.ts` - Functions for generating financial reports
- `supplierService.ts` - Integration point with the Inventory module

### 5. Type Layer
- Type definitions in `accounting.ts` with clear separation between:
  - Database entities (snake_case)
  - UI models (camelCase)

## Integration Points

The Accounting module integrates with:

1. **Inventory Module**: 
   - Tracks cost of goods
   - Manages inventory valuation
   - Records expenses for inventory purchases

2. **POS Module**:
   - Records sales as income entries
   - Provides transaction data for financial reporting
   - Helps calculate profit margins

## Data Flow

1. User actions in the UI trigger hooks (`useExpenses`, `useIncomes`, etc.)
2. Hooks call service functions that interact with the API/database
3. Service functions convert between UI models and database entities
4. Service responses are processed through hooks back to the UI
5. UI renders updated financial data

## Design Patterns

1. **Clear Entity/Model Separation**:
   - Database entities use snake_case (`merchant_id`)
   - UI models use camelCase (`merchantId`)

2. **Type Converter Utilities**:
   - `toExpenseModel()` / `toExpenseEntity()` functions
   - `toIncomeModel()` / `toIncomeEntity()` functions

3. **Tabbed Interface Pattern**:
   - Main accounting view uses tabs for different accounting functions
   - Consistent with other complex modules

## Future Enhancements

1. **Tax Report Generator**:
   - Automated tax form preparation
   - Tax liability forecasting

2. **Financial Planning Tools**:
   - Budget creation and tracking
   - Financial goal setting

3. **Invoice Management**:
   - Creating and sending invoices
   - Tracking invoice payments

4. **Bank Integration**:
   - Automated bank feed reconciliation
   - Direct payment processing
