# Sales Projections Implementation

This document outlines the implementation details and best practices for the Sales Projections module.

## Module Architecture

The Sales Projections module follows our established workflow pattern:

1. **Service Layer**: Core projection functionality in `salesProjector.ts`
2. **Hook Layer**: React hooks for component integration in `useSalesProjections.ts` 
3. **UI Layer**: Components for visualization in `SalesProjections/` directory
4. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests to ensure reliability

## Business Value

The Sales Projections module provides merchants with:

- Forward-looking revenue estimates based on historical data
- Adjustable growth parameters to model different scenarios
- Confidence levels based on data quality and quantity
- Seasonal adjustment options for more accurate forecasting
- Visual representation of future revenue trends

## Implementation Details

### Service Layer (`salesProjector.ts`)

- Fetches historical transaction data from Supabase
- Calculates growth trends based on previous periods
- Determines appropriate confidence levels
- Projects sales for requested number of future months

### Hook Layer (`useSalesProjections.ts`)

- Manages projection state (loading, error, results)
- Processes adjustments to growth parameters
- Provides derived metrics like total and average revenue
- Handles regeneration of projections with new parameters

### Component Layer

**ProjectionSettings.tsx**
- Controls for adjusting timeframe (3, 6, or 12 months)
- Growth adjustment slider (-50% to +50%)
- Toggle for seasonal adjustments
- Regenerate button for updating projections

**ProjectionResults.tsx**
- Visualization of projected sales using charts
- Summary metrics (total, average, confidence level) 
- Detailed breakdown of projection factors
- Loading and error states for better UX

### Page Integration

The `SalesProjectionsPage.tsx` integrates all components with:

- Tab navigation for different projection views
- Consistent layout following application design patterns
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Auth protection to ensure data security

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between data, logic, and UI
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures 
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of service failures with user feedback
4. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient data processing and state management
5. **Responsive Design**: Full compatibility across device sizes
6. **Testability**: Components designed for effective unit and integration testing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Forecast Accuracy Tracking**: Compare projections with actual results
2. **Scenario Modeling**: Save multiple projection scenarios for comparison
3. **Export Functionality**: Download projections as CSV/PDF
4. **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add additional chart types and drill-downs
5. **AI-Enhanced Projections**: Integrate machine learning for improved accuracy

## Integration Points

The Sales Projections module integrates with:

- **Authentication**: For user identity and merchant context
- **Transaction Data**: Historical basis for projections
- **Analytics Module**: For visualization components
- **Dashboard**: For summary metrics display
