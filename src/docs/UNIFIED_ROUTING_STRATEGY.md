# Unified Routing Strategy

This document outlines our improved approach to routing in the application, particularly focusing on the merchant modules.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Simplified Route Hierarchy**:
   - Removed nested path prefixes like `/merchant/dashboard` in favor of direct paths like `/dashboard`
   - Maintained backward compatibility with redirects from legacy paths

2. **Clear Route Responsibility**:
   - PublicRoutes: Handles authentication and redirects authenticated users
   - MainRouter: Central routing hub that directs to appropriate sections based on auth status
   - MerchantRoutes: Handles all merchant-specific routes without unnecessary nesting

3. **Consistent Navigation**:
   - Updated all navigation items to use the simplified direct paths
   - Enhanced active state detection for improved UX
   - Added proper debug logging to trace navigation issues

## Route Structure

### Public Routes
- `/login` - Login page
- `/register` - Registration page
- `/admin-login` - Super admin login

### Merchant Routes (Direct Paths)
- `/dashboard` - Main merchant dashboard
- `/inventory` - Inventory management
- `/customers` - Customer management
- `/products` - Product management
- `/pos` - Point of Sale system
- `/accounting` - Accounting features
- `/analytics` - Analytics dashboard
- `/payments` - Payment processing
- `/sales-projections` - Sales forecasting
- `/tax-reporting` - Tax management
- `/account` - Account management
- `/settings` - Application settings

### Super Admin Routes
- `/super-admin/...` - All super admin routes

## Best Practices

1. **Path Definition**:
   - Always use direct paths in MerchantRoutes (`/feature` not `/merchant/feature`)
   - Maintain consistent paths between navigation items and route definitions
   - Add redirects for legacy paths to ensure compatibility

2. **Route Debugging**:
   - Each route component should log its rendering with path information
   - Use descriptive logging that includes user role and component state
   - Track navigation events to trace user flow

3. **Route Protection**:
   - MainRouter handles top-level authentication checks
   - Role-based access is implemented at the router level
   - Unauthorized access redirects to clear error pages

By following this unified routing strategy, we maintain consistent navigation throughout the application while avoiding the blank screen issues previously encountered.
