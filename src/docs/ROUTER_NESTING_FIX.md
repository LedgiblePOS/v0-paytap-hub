# Router Nesting Issue and Fix

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing a fatal error with the message: "You cannot render a <Router> inside another <Router>. You should never have more than one in your app."

This error occurs when multiple Router components from react-router-dom are nested within each other. In our application, we had Router components in both `main.tsx` and `App.tsx`, creating this nesting issue.

## Symptoms

- White screen with "Application Error" message
- Console error: "You cannot render a <Router> inside another <Router>. You should never have more than one in your app."
- Application unable to render any content

## Root Cause Analysis

React Router's design requires that there be only one Router component in the component tree. This is because the Router creates a context that all routing components (like Route, Switch, useParams, useLocation, etc.) depend on. Having multiple Router components creates conflicting contexts.

In our application, we had:
1. A `BrowserRouter` in `main.tsx` wrapping the `App` component
2. Another `BrowserRouter` in `App.tsx` wrapping our application components

## Fix Implementation

The fix involved:

1. Removing the `BrowserRouter` from `App.tsx` while keeping the rest of the component hierarchy intact
2. Ensuring `main.tsx` correctly provides a single `Router` component
3. Updating related files to ensure they work with the corrected routing structure
4. Adding improved error handling for routing-related issues

## Preventing Future Issues

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Single Router Rule**: Always maintain a single Router component at the root of your application, typically in `main.tsx` or `index.tsx`
2. **Component Organization**: Keep route-related components (Routes, Route) organized in dedicated files
3. **Clear Ownership**: Make it clear which file "owns" the Router component
4. **Code Review Checks**: Add a specific review step for router-related changes
5. **Documentation**: Document the routing architecture in project documentation

## Related Files

- `main.tsx` - Now the sole provider of the Router component
- `App.tsx` - Modified to remove the duplicate Router
- Various route-related components - Adjusted to work with the single Router

This fix restores the application's ability to render content and navigation should now work as expected.
