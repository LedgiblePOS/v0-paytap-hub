# Error Resolutions Log

This document tracks the recurring errors we've fixed and the solutions implemented to prevent them from happening again.

## Subscription Tier Issues

### Problem:
Inconsistent usage of `SubscriptionTier` enum between files, with some components expecting `PROFESSIONAL` and `ENTERPRISE` properties that weren't defined.

### Solution:
- Ensured consistent enum definition in `src/types/subscription.ts`
- Added missing tiers (`PROFESSIONAL`, `ENTERPRISE`, `SCALE_UP`)
- Exported `TIER_REQUIREMENTS` for use in components

### Prevention:
- Use centralized type definitions 
- Don't repeat enum definitions across files
- Import from a single source

## ProductModel Type Errors

### Problem:
`name` was defined as optional in some places but required in the type definition.

### Solution:
- Updated `ProductModel` to ensure `name` is consistently required
- Fixed component implementation to always provide a name

### Prevention:
- Follow the Entity-Model pattern described in documentation
- Maintain single source of truth for type definitions

## User Role Type Conversion Issues

### Problem:
String values being assigned to UserRole enum types, causing TypeScript errors.

### Solution:
- Added proper type conversions in auth-related files
- Implemented type validation to handle string role values
- Added helper functions to safely convert string roles to enum values

### Prevention:
- Use type guards and validation
- Prefer early transformation at data boundaries
- Add helper functions for common type conversions

## Missing Hook Files

### Problem:
Multiple import errors for non-existent hook files.

### Solution:
- Implemented missing hooks (`useExpenses`, `useIncomes`, `useFinancialReporting`)
- Enhanced `useAccounting` to properly use the new hooks

### Prevention:
- Create stub implementations early
- Document dependencies between hooks
- Test imports after adding new files

## User Property Access Errors

### Problem:
Inconsistent property access on User objects, e.g., attempting to access `merchantId` that didn't exist.

### Solution:
- Updated `User` interface to include `merchantId`
- Added proper fallbacks in `useAccounting` and other hooks

### Prevention:
- Ensure interfaces match actual usage patterns
- Add detailed JSDoc comments for interfaces
- Implement consistent property naming

## Component Props Type Mismatches

### Problem:
Components receiving props that didn't match their defined interfaces.

### Solution:
- Created proper prop type definitions in `UserManagement/types.ts`
- Implemented missing dialog components
- Fixed component implementations to match expected prop types

### Prevention:
- Define prop interfaces before implementing components
- Use TypeScript to validate prop usage during development
- Avoid using `any` type for props

## Next Steps for Error Prevention

1. **Automated Type Checking**: 
   - Add pre-commit hooks for TypeScript type checking
   - Integrate type checking into CI/CD pipeline

2. **Component Documentation**:
   - Document expected prop types for each component
   - Create usage examples for complex components

3. **Code Reviews**:
   - Focus on type safety during code reviews
   - Ensure consistent type usage across the codebase

4. **Refactoring**:
   - Continue breaking large files into smaller, focused components
   - Improve separation of concerns between components
