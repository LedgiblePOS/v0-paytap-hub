# Production Infrastructure Setup Guide

This guide outlines the infrastructure setup for deploying our application to production with proper monitoring, backups, and scaling capabilities.

## Infrastructure Components

### 1. Frontend Hosting

We recommend using **Vercel** for hosting the React frontend application due to its:
- Seamless GitHub integration
- Automatic preview deployments
- Edge network for global content delivery
- Built-in monitoring and analytics

**Setup Steps:**
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
3. Set up custom domains and SSL certificates
4. Enable branch deployments for testing

### 2. Backend Infrastructure (Supabase)

Our application uses **Supabase** for backend services, which needs to be properly configured for production:

**Production Setup Steps:**
1. Upgrade to a paid Supabase plan for production workloads
2. Configure proper Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
3. Set up database backups:
   - Enable Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
   - Configure daily backups with 7-day retention
4. Create read-only database replicas for reporting/analytics
5. Set up proper user roles and permissions

### 3. Monitoring & Observability

#### Frontend Monitoring

1. **Error Tracking**
   - Implement [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for real-time error tracking
   - Configure error alerting for critical issues
   - Integrate with your team communication tools (Slack, Teams, etc.)

2. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**
   - Set up [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) or [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) for:
     - Page load performance metrics
     - API request monitoring
     - User experience tracking

3. **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**
   - Configure session recording and replay
   - Track user flows and conversion funnels
   - Monitor UI performance metrics

#### Backend Monitoring

1. **Database Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for:
     - High database load
     - Slow queries
     - Connection limits
     - Storage utilization

2. **API Monitoring**
   - Track API endpoint performance
   - Monitor rate limits and usage patterns
   - Set up alerts for API failures

### 4. Backup Strategy

1. **Database Backups**
   - Enable Supabase Point-in-Time Recovery
   - Schedule regular database exports to external storage
   - Validate backup restoration process quarterly

2. **Configuration Backups**
   - Store environment configurations in a secure vault
   - Back up Supabase webhook configurations
   - Document all external service integrations

3. **Disaster Recovery Plan**
   - Document step-by-step recovery procedures
   - Define Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
   - Conduct regular disaster recovery drills

### 5. Scaling Strategy

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Use serverless functions for API endpoints
   - Implement database connection pooling
   - Configure auto-scaling policies

2. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Monitor resource utilization
   - Upgrade Supabase plan as needed
   - Optimize database queries and indexes

### 6. Security Measures

1. **Authentication Security**
   - Implement proper session management
   - Set up multi-factor authentication for admin accounts
   - Configure password policies and account lockouts

2. **API Security**
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Use rate limiting for public endpoints
   - Validate all input data

3. **Data Security**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Set up data access logging

### 7. CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run automated tests on every commit
   - Perform code quality checks
   - Validate TypeScript compilation

2. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Implement staged deployments (dev → staging → production)
   - Configure automatic rollbacks for failed deployments
   - Implement feature flags for controlled rollouts

## Production Checklist

Before final production deployment, ensure:

- [ ] All environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Database backups are verified and scheduled
- [ ] Monitoring tools are set up and alerting properly
- [ ] SSL certificates are valid and auto-renewing
- [ ] Error handling is implemented across all components
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured for public endpoints
- [ ] Database indexes are optimized
- [ ] Logging is configured and retained appropriately
- [ ] Performance testing has been conducted
- [ ] Security audits have been completed

## Monitoring Configuration

### Implementing Sentry for Error Tracking

```typescript
// src/main.tsx
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: "YOUR_SENTRY_DSN",
    integrations: [
      new Sentry.BrowserTracing(),
      new Sentry.Replay()
    ],
    tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
    replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
    replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  });
}
```

### Database Health Check Endpoint

Create an edge function in Supabase that performs a health check:

```typescript
// supabase/functions/health-check/index.ts
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts'
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2'

serve(async (req) => {
  try {
    const supabase = createClient(
      Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL') ?? '',
      Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_ANON_KEY') ?? ''
    )
    
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('health_checks')
      .select('*')
      .limit(1)
    
    if (error) throw error
    
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ 
        status: 'healthy',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      }),
      { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
    )
  } catch (error) {
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ 
        status: 'unhealthy',
        error: error.message,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      }),
      { 
        status: 500,
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } 
      }
    )
  }
})
```

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

1. **Weekly Maintenance:**
   - Review error logs
   - Check database performance
   - Validate backup integrity

2. **Monthly Maintenance:**
   - Apply security updates
   - Review access permissions
   - Analyze usage patterns
   - Optimize database queries

3. **Quarterly Maintenance:**
   - Conduct security audits
   - Test disaster recovery procedures
   - Review and update documentation
   - Performance testing and optimization

By following this guide, you'll have a robust, scalable, and maintainable production environment for our application.
