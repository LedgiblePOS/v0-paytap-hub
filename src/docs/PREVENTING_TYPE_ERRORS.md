# Preventing TypeScript Errors: Best Practices

## Common Error Types and Solutions

### 1. Import Naming Conflicts

**Error Example:**
```
error TS2395: Individual declarations in merged declaration 'X' must be all exported or all local.
error TS2440: Import declaration conflicts with local declaration of 'X'.
```

**Cause:** This occurs when you import a function, type, or variable with the same name as something you're defining in the current file.

**Solution:**
- Use named aliases when importing to avoid conflicts:
  ```typescript
  // WRONG
  import { getUserData } from './authApi';
  export const getUserData = async () => { /* ... */ };

  // RIGHT
  import { getUserData as fetchUserData } from './authApi';
  export const getUserData = async () => { /* ... */ };
  ```

### 2. Type Definition Conflicts

**Error Example:**
```
error TS2717: Subsequent property declarations must have the same type.
```

**Cause:** This occurs when the same property is defined multiple times with different types.

**Solution:**
- Ensure consistent types across all declarations
- Use interface extension instead of redefinition:
  ```typescript
  // WRONG
  interface User { name: string; }
  interface User { age: number; } // Error

  // RIGHT
  interface User { name: string; }
  interface UserWithAge extends User { age: number; } // OK
  ```

### 3. Missing or Invalid Exports

**Error Example:**
```
error TS2305: Module has no exported member 'X'.
```

**Cause:** Trying to import something that isn't exported from the module.

**Solution:**
- Double-check export statements in the source file
- Make sure names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Use IDE features to verify exports before importing

## Best Practices for Error Prevention

### 1. Consistent Naming Conventions

- Use unique names for functions, variables, and imports
- When naming collisions are unavoidable, use aliases (`import { x as y }`)
- Follow a project-wide naming pattern (e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for types)

### 2. Code Organization

- Split large files into smaller, focused modules
- Group related functionality in the same file/module
- Place shared types in dedicated type files

### 3. Import Management

- Use explicit imports rather than wildcard imports
- Import only what you need from each module
- Sort imports alphabetically for easier management

### 4. Type Checking Workflow

- Run TypeScript type checking regularly:
  ```bash
  npm run type-check
  ```
- Use IDEs with TypeScript integration for real-time error checking
- Add pre-commit hooks to prevent committing code with type errors

### 5. Error Validation

When encountering TypeScript errors:
1. Read the error message carefully - it usually tells you exactly what's wrong
2. Look at the referenced line numbers
3. Check for naming conflicts and typos first
4. Verify that all imports match their corresponding exports
5. Make sure your types are consistent

By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce TypeScript errors in your project and improve overall code quality.
