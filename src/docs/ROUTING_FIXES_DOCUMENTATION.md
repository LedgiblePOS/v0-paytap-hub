This document tracks fixes made to the routing system to address navigation and URL issues.

## API Credentials Path Fix (2025-04-14)

### Issue
Users were experiencing 404 errors when trying to access `/api-credentials` directly or after page refresh.

### Root Cause
- The direct `/api-credentials` path was not defined in any route configuration
- Both merchant and super admin interfaces have API credentials pages but at different paths
- The navigation menu items were using inconsistent paths for the same feature

### Solution
1. Added direct redirects in both route files:
   - In `SuperAdminRoutes.tsx`: `/api-credentials` → `/super-admin/settings/api-credentials`
   - In `MerchantRoutes.tsx`: `/api-credentials` → `/settings/api-credentials`

2. Updated navigation items to use consistent paths:
   - Made sure the API Credentials navigation item in `SuperAdminNavItems.tsx` points to the correct path

3. Added special case handling in `AppRoutes.tsx`:
   - Detects `/api-credentials` path and redirects to the appropriate path based on user role
   - This ensures the user always lands on the correct page regardless of which path they use

4. Added missing nested routes:
   - Added explicit route for `/super-admin/settings/api-credentials` in SuperAdminRoutes

### Verification Steps
To verify this fix:
1. Log in as a Super Admin
2. Navigate to `/api-credentials` directly
3. Should be redirected to `/super-admin/settings/api-credentials`
4. Repeat test with Merchant user

## Tax Reporting Route Fix (2025-04-14)

### Issue
Users were experiencing 404 errors when accessing `/tax` or related tax pages.

### Root Cause
- The `/tax` route was defined in the navigation but not implemented in the route components
- Different paths were used for tax reporting between merchant and super admin interfaces
- Missing redirect rules for cross-interface routes

### Solution
1. Added Tax Reporting routes to both interfaces:
   - Added `/tax` to MerchantRoutes
   - Added `/super-admin/tax` to SuperAdminRoutes

2. Implemented redirection logic:
   - Super admin users accessing `/tax` will be redirected to `/super-admin/tax`

3. Added placeholder components:
   - Created `ModulePlaceholder` component for features under development
   - Implemented a basic Tax Reporting component with role-specific interfaces

4. Updated navigation to include consistent tax reporting links:
   - Added Tax Reporting entry in SuperAdminNavItems

### Verification Steps
1. Log in as a Super Admin
2. Try accessing `/tax` directly (should redirect to `/super-admin/tax`)
3. Click on Tax Reporting in the navigation menu (should navigate to `/super-admin/tax`)
4. Check if the correct content is displayed based on role

## Super Admin Sidebar Fix (2025-04-14)

### Issue
Super Admin sidebar was not displaying correctly and navigation between pages was broken.

### Root Cause
- Inconsistent routing patterns between the sidebar navigation items and the actual routes
- Navigation items were using client-side links but not preventing default behavior
- Missing routes for nested paths like "/super-admin/settings/api-credentials"

### Solution
1. Updated `SidebarNavigationItems.tsx` to:
   - Use React Router's navigation instead of plain links
   - Properly detect current path for highlighting active items
   - Add comprehensive logging to track rendering issues

2. Fixed route configurations in `SuperAdminRoutes.tsx`:
   - Added missing nested routes for settings pages
   - Ensured API credentials route is properly defined

3. Enhanced debugging to identify sidebar rendering issues:
   - Added role detection logging
   - Added path matching to ensure active states are correctly applied
   - Added timestamp tracking for render cycles

### Verification Steps
1. Log in as a Super Admin
2. Verify sidebar appears on initial page load at `/super-admin`
3. Navigate between sections using sidebar links
4. Refresh page on different routes to ensure sidebar still appears
5. Check browser console for debugging information

## 404 Pages Improvement (2025-04-14)

### Issue
Users were experiencing generic 404 pages with no way to navigate back to valid routes.

### Solution
1. Enhanced the NotFound component to:
   - Display more helpful information
   - Provide links to common valid routes
   - Log attempted access to non-existent routes

2. Implemented role-specific fallbacks in route definitions:
   - Super admin routes fall back to either a placeholder or not found page
   - Merchant routes show appropriate fallback content

3. Added comprehensive route handling in `AppRoutes.tsx`:
   - Catch-all routes for authenticated and unauthenticated users
   - Role-specific default routes

### Verification Steps
1. Try accessing a non-existent route (e.g., "/super-admin/non-existent")
2. Verify the Not Found page displays
3. Confirm that navigation options are provided to return to valid pages

## Known Routing Patterns

For reference, these are the correct routing patterns in the application:

### Merchant User Routes
- Dashboard: `/dashboard`
- Settings: `/settings/*` (nested routes under settings)
- API Credentials (Merchant): `/settings/api-credentials`
- Account: `/account/*`
- Tax Reporting: `/tax`

### Super Admin Routes
- Dashboard: `/super-admin`
- User Management: `/super-admin/users`
- Settings: `/super-admin/settings/*`
- API Credentials (Admin): `/super-admin/settings/api-credentials`
- Tax Reporting: `/super-admin/tax`

## Best Practices for Route Management

1. Always define route paths in constants to maintain consistency
2. Use nested routes with proper React Router v6 patterns
3. Implement catch-all routes to handle undefined paths
4. Ensure navigation items use the exact same paths defined in route components
5. Add console logging to track route rendering and navigation for debugging
