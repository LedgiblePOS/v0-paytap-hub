# Monitoring and Logging Guide

This guide outlines the comprehensive monitoring and logging strategy for your application in production.

## Logging Strategy

### Application Logging

We've set up a multi-level logging system using our custom `errorMonitoringService`:

1. **Log Levels**
   - DEBUG: Detailed debugging information
   - INFO: General information about application flow
   - WARNING: Warning events that might lead to errors
   - ERROR: Error events that allow recovery
   - CRITICAL: Critical errors requiring immediate attention

2. **Log Contexts**
   - Each log includes contextual information:
     - User ID (when available)
     - Session ID
     - Component/Module
     - Request/Transaction ID
     - Environment information

### Structured Logging Format

All logs follow a consistent JSON structure for easy parsing and analysis:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-05-10T12:34:56Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "message": "Failed to process payment",
  "context": {
    "userId": "user-123",
    "component": "PaymentProcessor",
    "transactionId": "tx-456"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "paymentMethod": "CARD",
    "errorCode": "PAYMENT_DECLINED"
  },
  "stackTrace": "..."
}
```

## Monitoring Infrastructure

### Real-time Monitoring

1. **Application Health**
   - Endpoint health checks (every 30 seconds)
   - Database connection monitoring
   - API response times

2. **User Experience**
   - Page load times
   - API response times
   - Error rates
   - Session duration

3. **System Resources**
   - CPU/Memory usage
   - Database connection pool
   - Network traffic

### Alerting System

We've configured alerts for critical events:

1. **High-Priority Alerts**
   - Application downtime
   - Error rate spikes (>5% over 5 minutes)
   - Authentication failures (>10 in 1 minute)
   - Payment processing failures

2. **Medium-Priority Alerts**
   - Slow API responses (>2s for 5 minutes)
   - Database connection issues
   - Memory usage >85%
   - Disk space <10% free

3. **Low-Priority Alerts**
   - Page load times >3s
   - CPU usage >80% for 10 minutes
   - Abnormal traffic patterns

## Monitoring Tools Integration

Our application integrates with these monitoring services:

### Error Tracking

```typescript
// How to log errors with our monitoring service
import errorMonitoringService, { ErrorSeverity, ErrorSource } from '@/services/errorMonitoringService';

try {
  // Your code
} catch (error) {
  errorMonitoringService.trackError({
    message: error.message,
    severity: ErrorSeverity.ERROR,
    source: ErrorSource.PAYMENT,
    metadata: { orderId: '123', amount: 99.99 }
  });
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
// How to track performance metrics
import performanceMonitoring from '@/services/performanceMonitoringService';

// Start a performance trace
const traceId = performanceMonitoring.startTrace('checkout-flow');

// Later
performanceMonitoring.endTrace(traceId);
```

## Dashboard Setup

Our monitoring dashboard visualizes these key metrics:

1. **Business Metrics**
   - Daily active users
   - Transaction volume and success rate
   - Revenue trends
   - User acquisition and retention

2. **Technical Metrics**
   - Error rates by component
   - API performance
   - Database performance
   - Server health

## Incident Response

When issues are detected:

1. **Automatic Response**
   - High severity errors trigger automatic notifications
   - Rate limiting activates for suspicious traffic
   - Self-healing mechanisms attempt recovery

2. **Manual Response Protocol**
   - On-call engineer receives notification
   - Initial assessment (within 15 minutes)
   - Root cause analysis
   - Resolution and post-mortem

## Implementing Monitoring in New Features

When developing new features, ensure proper monitoring by:

1. Adding appropriate error tracking:
   ```typescript
   try {
     // Feature code
   } catch (error) {
     errorMonitoringService.trackError({
       message: `Feature X failed: ${error.message}`,
       severity: ErrorSeverity.ERROR,
       source: ErrorSource.FEATURE_X
     });
     
     // User-friendly fallback
     return fallbackBehavior();
   }
   ```

2. Including performance tracking:
   ```typescript
   const perfId = performanceMonitoring.startTrace('feature-x-execution');
   // Feature code
   performanceMonitoring.endTrace(perfId);
   ```

3. Adding business event logging:
   ```typescript
   enhancedAuditService.logAudit(
     'feature_used', 
     'feature_x', 
     `User completed feature X with result: ${result}`, 
     userId
   );
   ```

This comprehensive monitoring and logging approach ensures we can detect, diagnose, and resolve issues quickly while maintaining high application reliability.
