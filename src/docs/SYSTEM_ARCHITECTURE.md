# System Architecture Documentation

This document outlines the overall architecture of our merchant management platform, including key components, data flow, and integration points.

## System Overview

Our application is a multi-tenant SaaS platform designed for retail merchants to manage their business operations. It provides point-of-sale functionality, inventory management, customer relationship management, analytics, and reporting features.

### Key Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI library with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API and React Query
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, serverless functions)
- **Payments**: Integration with multiple payment processors
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions

## System Components

### 1. Core Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│              UI Layer                 │
│  (React Components, Shadcn UI, etc.)  │
├───────────────────────────────────────┤
│            Business Logic             │
│     (Hooks, Services, Utilities)      │
├───────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Data Access Layer           │
│      (API Clients, Data Services)     │
├───────────────────────────────────────┤
│          Supabase Platform            │
│  (Database, Auth, Storage, Functions) │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Frontend Architecture

The frontend application is structured around feature modules:

- **Components**: Reusable UI components organized by feature
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for business logic and data access
- **Services**: Core services for API communication, authentication, etc.
- **Types**: TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- **Utils**: Utility functions and helper methods
- **Routes**: Application routing and navigation

### 3. Role-Based Access Control

The system implements a comprehensive role-based access control system:

- **Super Admin**: Platform administrators with access to all merchants and system settings
- **Merchant**: Business owners with access to their own business data only
- **Staff**: Employees with limited access based on assigned permissions

### 4. Database Model

The data model uses a multi-tenant architecture with key entities:

- **Users**: User accounts with authentication information
- **Merchants**: Business entities that own products, orders, customers
- **Products**: Inventory items with pricing and availability information
- **Orders**: Customer purchases with line items and payment details
- **Customers**: Customer information and purchase history
- **Audit Logs**: Security and activity tracking

### 5. Entity-Model Conversion Pattern

The system uses a consistent Entity-Model pattern for data handling:

- **Database Entities**: Use snake_case naming (e.g., `first_name`, `is_active`)
- **UI Models**: Use camelCase naming (e.g., `firstName`, `isActive`)
- **Converters**: Transform data between database and UI representations

## Data Flow

### 1. Authentication Flow

```
┌──────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│  Login   │────▶│  Supabase   │────▶│ Auth Token  │────▶│  App     │
│  Form    │     │  Auth API   │     │ Generation  │     │  Access  │
└──────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────────┘
```

1. User submits credentials through login form
2. Supabase Auth API validates credentials
3. JWT token is generated and stored
4. User is redirected to appropriate dashboard based on role

### 2. Product Management Flow

```
┌──────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│  Product │────▶│  Product    │────▶│  Supabase   │────▶│ Database │
│  Forms   │     │  Service    │     │  Client     │     │  Update  │
└──────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────────┘
                                           │
┌──────────┐     ┌─────────────┐           │
│  UI      │◀───▶│  React      │◀──────────┘
│  Update  │     │  Query      │
└──────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

1. User creates/edits product through product forms
2. Product service processes data and converts to correct format
3. Supabase client sends update to database
4. React Query manages caching and UI updates

### 3. POS System Flow

```
┌──────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Product │────▶│  Shopping   │────▶│  Checkout   │
│  Select  │     │  Cart       │     │  Process    │
└──────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                                           │
                                           ▼
┌──────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Receipt │◀───▶│  Order      │◀───▶│  Payment    │
│  Generation│    │  Creation   │     │  Processing │
└──────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

1. Merchant selects products and adds to cart
2. Checkout process calculates totals and taxes
3. Payment is processed through payment gateway
4. Order is created in database
5. Receipt is generated for customer
