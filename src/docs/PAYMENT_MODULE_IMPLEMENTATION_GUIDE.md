# Payment Module Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Payment Module enables merchants to process and manage various payment methods. It integrates with the POS system to handle transactions and provides a unified interface for payment processing.

## Core Payment Methods

1. **Tap to Pay**: NFC-based contactless payments via the FasstapService
2. **Cash**: Manual cash transaction recording
3. **CBDC**: Central Bank Digital Currency payments 
4. **Split Payments**: Support for transactions using multiple payment methods

## Module Architecture

The Payment Module follows our established architectural pattern:

### 1. Page Layer
- `pages/Payments/Index.tsx` - Main entry point for payment settings and configuration
- `components/Checkout/PaymentFlow.tsx` - Payment processing UI in the checkout flow

### 2. Component Layer
- `PaymentMethodSelector.tsx` - UI for selecting payment methods
- `PaymentButton.tsx` - Button component for initiating payments
- `PaymentControls.tsx` - Controls for configuration options
- `PaymentMethodIndicator.tsx` - Visual indicator of payment method selection
- `PaymentConfirmation.tsx` - Success/failure handling after payment

### 3. Service Layer
- `paymentService.ts` - Core payment processing logic
- `paymentProcessor.ts` - Orchestrates payment flow
- `transactionService.ts` - Records transactions in the database
- `checkoutService.ts` - Manages the checkout process
- `settingsManager.ts` - Handles payment configuration

### 4. Integration Layer
- `FasstapService.ts` - NFC payment integration
- `CBDCService.ts` - Digital currency integration
- `bridgeService.ts` - Native SDK bridge implementation

### 5. Types
- `types/payments.ts` - Payment-specific type definitions

## Data Flow

1. User initiates checkout in POS
2. Selects payment method
3. Payment processor handles the request based on method
4. Transaction is recorded in database
5. Receipt/confirmation is generated

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up payment services
   - Implement basic payment flow
   - Add tap-to-pay integration

2. **Phase 2: Payment Methods**
   - Add cash payment handling
   - Implement CBDC integration
   - Add payment method selection UI

3. **Phase 3: Settings & Configuration**
   - Create payment settings interface
   - Add payment method toggling
   - Implement merchant credentials management

4. **Phase 4: Analytics & Reporting**
   - Add payment analytics dashboard
   - Implement transaction reporting
   - Add reconciliation features

## Integration Points

- **POS Module**: Payment processing for checkout
- **Inventory Module**: Updating stock after successful payment
- **Customer Module**: Associating transactions with customers
- **Accounting Module**: Financial record keeping

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: For payment service functions
2. **Integration Tests**: For payment flow
3. **E2E Tests**: For complete checkout process
4. **Mock Tests**: For external payment processors

## Security Considerations

1. Secure handling of payment credentials
2. Encryption of sensitive data
3. Compliance with payment industry standards
4. Proper error handling and logging

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Payment Methods**
   - Online payment gateways
   - Mobile payment apps
   - Cryptocurrency

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Recurring payments
   - Installment plans
   - Loyalty program integration
   - Refund processing
