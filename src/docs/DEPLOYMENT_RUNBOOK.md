# Deployment Runbook

This runbook provides comprehensive instructions for deploying and maintaining the application across different environments.

## Deployment Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Access URL | Database |
|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Development | Active development and testing | https://dev.example.com | Supabase Development |
| Staging | Pre-production verification | https://staging.example.com | Supabase Staging |
| Production | Customer-facing environment | https://app.example.com | Supabase Production |

## Deployment Prerequisites

Before starting any deployment process, ensure the following:

1. **Access Permissions**:
   - GitHub repository access
   - Vercel project access
   - Supabase project access
   - DNS management access (for domain configuration)

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Verify all required environment variables are configured in the deployment platform
   - Ensure sensitive credentials are stored securely

3. **Database Migrations**:
   - Review any pending database migrations
   - Understand the impact of schema changes
   - Plan rollback strategy if needed

## Standard Deployment Process

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run and pass all automated tests
- [ ] Verify build completes successfully locally
- [ ] Ensure documentation is up-to-date
- [ ] Check for any dependencies that need updating
- [ ] Review the changes to be deployed
- [ ] Notify stakeholders about upcoming deployment

### Step 2: Database Migrations

1. **Review Migration Scripts**:
   ```bash
   # Export pending migrations list
   supabase db diff --schema public --use-migra > pending_migrations.sql
   ```

2. **Backup Current Database State**:
   ```bash
   # Create a database backup
   supabase db dump -f pre_migration_backup.sql
   ```

3. **Apply Migrations to Staging First**:
   ```bash
   # Apply migrations to staging
   supabase db push --db-url $STAGING_DB_URL
   ```

4. **Verify Migration Success**:
   - Check for any errors in migration logs
   - Verify data integrity after migration
   - Test application functionality with new schema

5. **Prepare Production Migration**:
   ```bash
   # Generate migration script for production
   supabase db diff --schema public --use-migra --from prod --to staging > prod_migration.sql
   ```

### Step 3: Code Deployment

#### Vercel Deployment

1. **Deploy to Staging**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy current branch to staging
   vercel deploy --prod --scope=your-team --env=staging
   ```

2. **Run Smoke Tests on Staging**:
   - Verify critical user paths work correctly
   - Check for any console errors
   - Validate API endpoints are accessible

3. **Deploy to Production**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy to production environment
   vercel deploy --prod --scope=your-team
   ```

4. **Verify Production Deployment**:
   - Check application health monitors
   - Verify DNS configuration and SSL certificates
   - Run production smoke tests

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Monitor Application Health**:
   - Check error rates in monitoring tools
   - Verify API response times are within acceptable ranges
   - Monitor database performance metrics

2. **User Experience Validation**:
   - Test critical user flows
   - Verify all integrations are functioning
   - Check responsive design on different devices

3. **Performance Benchmarking**:
   - Run performance tests
   - Identify any regressions
   - Document baseline metrics

### Step 5: Deployment Documentation

1. **Update Deployment Records**:
   - Document version deployed
   - Note any issues encountered and their solutions
   - Record deployment duration and metrics

2. **Notify Stakeholders**:
   - Send deployment completion notification
   - Provide summary of changes deployed
   - Share any known issues or limitations

## Rollback Procedures

### Code Rollback

If issues are detected in the deployed code:

1. **Initiate Rollback**:
   ```bash
   # Rollback to previous deployment
   vercel rollback --scope=your-team
   ```

2. **Verify Rollback Success**:
   - Confirm previous version is running
   - Check system functionality
   - Notify stakeholders of the rollback

### Database Rollback

For database issues that require rollback:

1. **Evaluate Impact**:
   - Determine if the issue can be fixed with a forward migration
   - Assess impact of rollback on data integrity

2. **Simple Schema Rollback**:
   ```bash
   # Apply reverse migration
   supabase db execute -f rollback_migration.sql
   ```

3. **Complex Recovery**:
   - For serious issues, restore from backup
   - Apply any transactions that occurred since backup
   - Verify data integrity after restore

## Environment-Specific Procedures

### Development Environment

- **Purpose**: Daily development and testing
- **Update Frequency**: Continuous
- **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests pass
- **Approval Process**: None required

### Staging Environment

- **Purpose**: Pre-release testing and verification
- **Update Frequency**: After feature completion
- **Testing Requirements**: Integration tests pass
- **Approval Process**: Tech lead review

### Production Environment

- **Purpose**: Live customer-facing application
- **Update Frequency**: Scheduled releases
- **Testing Requirements**: Full test suite pass
- **Approval Process**: Release manager approval

## Common Issues and Solutions

### SSL Certificate Expiration

**Symptom**: Users see security warnings when accessing the site.

**Solution**:
1. Check certificate status:
   ```bash
   openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in /path/to/cert.pem
   ```
2. Renew certificate through your provider
3. Update certificate in Vercel project settings

### Database Connection Issues

**Symptom**: Application returns database connection errors.

**Solution**:
1. Verify connection strings in environment variables
2. Check database server status
3. Review connection pool settings
4. Check for IP restrictions or firewall rules

### Deployment Timeouts

**Symptom**: Deployment process hangs or times out.

**Solution**:
1. Check build logs for long-running processes
2. Optimize build process (reduce bundle size, improve caching)
3. Increase build timeout settings if needed

   ```

2. **Database Vacuum**:
   ```sql
   VACUUM ANALYZE;
   ```

3. **Check for Slow Queries**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active' ORDER BY duration DESC;
   ```
