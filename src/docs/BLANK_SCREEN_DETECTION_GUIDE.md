# Blank Screen Detection and Recovery Guide

This document explains how our blank screen detection system works and how we resolved TypeScript errors in the implementation.

## System Overview

Our application implements a robust blank screen detection and recovery mechanism to prevent users from experiencing white/blank pages. The system works through multiple layers:

1. **Content Detection Strategies**:
   - Direct DOM inspection for visible content
   - Detection of specific data attributes (`data-content-ready`, `data-testid`)
   - Verification of DOM structure and content
   - Multiple retry attempts with exponential backoff

2. **Recovery Options**:
   - Page refresh button
   - Navigation back button
   - Return to dashboard option
   - User-friendly error notifications

## Error Resolution

### TypeScript Errors Fixed

We resolved the following TypeScript errors in the BlankScreenRecovery component:

```
Property 'hasMainContent' does not exist on type...
Property 'hasPlaceholder' does not exist on type...
Property 'rootMarked' does not exist on type...
```

**Solution**:
- Created an enhanced state object by extending the base UI state
- Added the missing properties to this enhanced object
- Properly typed all properties to ensure type safety

```typescript
// Before:
const uiState = inspectRouteUI();
// ...later trying to access properties that don't exist on uiState

// After:
const uiState = inspectRouteUI();
const enhancedUiState = {
  ...uiState,
  hasMainContent,
  hasPlaceholder,
  rootMarked: !!rootMarked,
  hasReadyContent,
  attempt: currentAttempt,
};
```

## Best Practices for Content Detection

1. **Multiple Detection Methods**:
   - Never rely on a single detection strategy
   - Implement both specific selectors and general content checks
   - Use data attributes (`data-testid`, `data-content-ready`) for reliable detection

2. **Progressive Enhancement**:
   - Start with basic content checks
   - Add specific element checks
   - Include fallback detection methods

3. **Exponential Backoff**:
   - Begin with short intervals and increase with each retry
   - Cap maximum timeout to prevent excessive wait times
   - Limit total number of attempts (5 in our implementation)

4. **User Feedback**:
   - Only show recovery UI after multiple failed attempts
   - Provide clear instructions for recovery options
   - Use non-alarming toast notifications

## Preparing Modules for Production

Before linking modules to the super admin interface, ensure each module:

1. Implements proper content detection via:
   - Appropriate `data-testid` attributes
   - `data-content-ready="true"` markup
   - Visible content validation

2. Uses the following safety measures:
   - Error boundaries around route components
   - Loading states with timeouts
   - Fallback UI components

3. Passes the following checks:
   - No TypeScript errors
   - Content properly renders in all routes
   - Blank screen detection works reliably
