# Security Checklist

This checklist outlines the security measures implemented in the application and provides guidance for maintaining and extending security features.

## Authentication Security

✅ **Strong Password Policy**
- Minimum length: 8 characters
- Requires uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Rate-limiting on login attempts

✅ **Session Management**
- JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
- Secure storage of tokens (memory, not localStorage)
- Automatic token refresh
- Session invalidation on logout

✅ **Multi-factor Authentication**
- Email verification for new accounts
- Support for optional 2FA

## Authorization Security

✅ **Role-Based Access Control**
- Well-defined user roles (USER, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN)
- Permission-based access to resources
- Properly secured API endpoints

✅ **Data Access Controls**
- Row-level security in database
- API endpoint permission checks
- Frontend access control enforcement

## Input Validation & Sanitization

✅ **Form Input Validation**
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Server-side validation for security
- Proper error handling and feedback

✅ **Content Sanitization**
- HTML sanitization to prevent XSS
- SQL injection protection
- File upload validation and sanitization

## API Security

✅ **CSRF Protection**
- Token-based CSRF protection
- Same-site cookies
- Proper headers for state-changing operations

✅ **Rate Limiting**
- API request limits by endpoint
- Graduated response to excessive requests
- Proper error responses for rate-limited requests

✅ **Request/Response Security**
- Content-Security-Policy headers
- X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection headers
- HTTPS enforced for all communications

## Data Protection

✅ **Sensitive Data Handling**
- No sensitive data in frontend code
- Appropriate encryption for sensitive data
- Secure data transmission (TLS/SSL)

✅ **Error Handling**
- Custom error handling to prevent information leakage
- Structured error logging
- User-friendly error messages

## Audit & Monitoring

✅ **Security Event Logging**
- Authentication attempts logged
- Permission violations tracked
- API abuse detection

✅ **Security Auditing Tools**
- Regular security scans
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- Security audit reports

## Security Testing

✅ **Security Tests**
- Authentication flow testing
- Permission boundary testing
- Input validation testing

## Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run full security audit using Security Audit tool
- [ ] Verify all critical and high issues are resolved
- [ ] Check for npm dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ensure proper CORS configuration for production
- [ ] Verify CSP headers are correctly set for production
- [ ] Confirm all authentication flows work correctly
- [ ] Test all permission boundaries
- [ ] Validate input handling against common attack vectors
