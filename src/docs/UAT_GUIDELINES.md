# User Acceptance Testing Guidelines

This document outlines the process for conducting User Acceptance Testing (UAT) before launching the application.

## UAT Objectives

User Acceptance Testing is the final verification stage before releasing the application to production. The main objectives are:

1. **Validate Business Requirements**: Ensure the application meets all specified business requirements
2. **Verify End-to-End Workflows**: Test complete business processes from start to finish
3. **Collect Stakeholder Feedback**: Gather input from business users for potential improvements
4. **Identify Business Process Issues**: Discover any usability or workflow issues before launch
5. **Validate Data Accuracy**: Ensure system generates correct outputs for business scenarios

## UAT Roles and Responsibilities

### Business Stakeholders
- Test the application from a business perspective
- Verify business workflows and requirements
- Provide feedback on usability and functionality
- Sign off on UAT completion

### Product Managers
- Coordinate UAT sessions
- Document test results and feedback
- Prioritize identified issues
- Manage UAT timeline and schedule

### Developers
- Provide technical support during UAT
- Address critical issues discovered during testing
- Assist with test environment setup and data preparation

## UAT Process

### 1. Test Planning

- Define UAT scope and objectives
- Create test scenarios based on business requirements
- Prepare test data and environment
- Establish acceptance criteria
- Define UAT timeline and milestones

### 2. Test Execution

- Follow the predefined test scenarios
- Document test results for each step
- Record any issues or observations
- Capture screenshots for relevant scenarios
- Track test coverage against requirements

### 3. Issue Management

- Document issues with clear steps to reproduce
- Categorize issues by severity:
  - **Critical**: Prevents business functions from working
  - **High**: Major feature not working correctly
  - **Medium**: Function works but has significant issues
  - **Low**: Minor issues that don't affect functionality

- Prioritize issues for resolution
- Track issue status and resolution

### 4. Feedback Collection

- Gather feedback from all stakeholders
- Document suggestions for future improvements
- Identify potential usability enhancements
- Record any business process changes required

### 5. UAT Sign-Off

- Review test results against acceptance criteria
- Confirm all critical issues are resolved
- Document known issues and workarounds
- Obtain formal approval from business stakeholders

## UAT Documentation

### Required Documents

1. **UAT Test Plan**: Outlines testing objectives, scope, and approach
2. **Test Scenarios**: Detailed test cases with steps and expected results
3. **Issue Log**: Documentation of all identified issues
4. **UAT Sign-Off Form**: Formal approval document for production release

### Test Case Format

Each test case should include:

- Unique identifier
- Description of the test scenario
- Preconditions and test data requirements
- Detailed test steps
- Expected results for each step
- Status (Passed/Failed/Blocked/Not Tested)
- Actual results and observations
- Screenshots (if applicable)

## UAT Best Practices

1. **Involve Actual Users**: Include representatives from all user roles
2. **Use Real-World Scenarios**: Test with business-relevant cases
3. **Prepare Test Data Carefully**: Ensure data covers all testing needs
4. **Test Negative Scenarios**: Verify system handles errors properly
5. **Test End-to-End Workflows**: Don't just test isolated features
6. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of tests and results
7. **Test Early and Often**: Don't wait until the end of development
8. **Set Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Define what "done" means
9. **Test in a Production-Like Environment**: Match production settings
10. **Verify All Integrations**: Test connections with other systems

## Post-UAT Activities

After UAT completion:

1. Create a summary report of UAT results
2. Document any outstanding issues with workarounds
3. Identify and schedule post-launch improvements
4. Review the UAT process for future improvements
5. Archive UAT documentation for reference

## UAT Metrics and Reporting

Track and report on these key metrics during UAT:

1. Total test cases executed vs. planned
2. Percentage of test cases passed
3. Number of critical issues identified
4. Number of issues resolved vs. outstanding
5. UAT timeline compliance
6. Business requirements coverage

## UAT Timeline

A typical UAT timeline includes:

1. **UAT Planning**: 1-2 weeks
2. **Environment Setup**: 1 week
3. **Test Execution**: 2-4 weeks
4. **Issue Resolution**: Ongoing during execution
5. **UAT Sign-Off**: 1 week

Adjust this timeline based on project complexity and scale.
