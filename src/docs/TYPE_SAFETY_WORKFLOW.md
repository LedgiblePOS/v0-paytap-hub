# Type Safety Workflow

This document outlines our comprehensive workflow for ensuring type safety throughout the application, with automatic refactoring as a core component.

## Prevention → Detection → Correction → Refactoring

Our type safety workflow follows a continuous cycle:

### 1. Prevention

- **Type-First Development**: Define types before implementation
- **Comprehensive Interfaces**: Document all parameters and return types
- **Consistent Patterns**: Maintain uniform type patterns across components
- **Boundary Validation**: Add runtime checks at system boundaries

### 2. Detection

- **Automated Type Checking**: Run TypeScript compiler in strict mode
- **Code Reviews**: Include type safety in code review checklists
- **Runtime Type Monitoring**: Add logging for unexpected type conditions

### 3. Correction

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Address underlying causes, not just symptoms
- **Consistent Fixes**: Apply fixes consistently across the codebase
- **Documentation**: Document the fix pattern for future reference

### 4. Automatic Refactoring

- **Size Triggers**: Automatically refactor when modules exceed size limits
- **Complexity Triggers**: Refactor when cyclomatic complexity exceeds thresholds
- **Duplication Triggers**: Extract shared patterns when duplication is detected
- **Type Consistency**: Ensure consistent typing across related components

## Automatic Refactoring Guidelines

### Component Refactoring

When a component exceeds 150 lines or uses 7+ props:

1. Extract child components for logical UI sections
2. Create custom hooks for complex logic
3. Move types to centralized type files
4. Create wrapper components for consistent UI patterns

### Hook Refactoring

When a hook exceeds 100 lines or manages 5+ state variables:

1. Split into smaller, focused hooks
2. Extract pure utility functions
3. Use composition to combine simpler hooks
4. Ensure consistent return type patterns

### Type Definition Refactoring

When interfaces become complex:

1. Use composition with smaller interfaces
2. Extract common properties to shared interfaces
3. Use discriminated unions for state variations
4. Document type constraints with JSDoc

## Implementation Workflow

For each feature or bug fix:

1. **Analyze**: Review existing code for type patterns
2. **Plan**: Determine if refactoring is needed before implementation
3. **Implement**: Apply the feature with comprehensive typing
4. **Refactor**: Automatically apply refactoring if thresholds are exceeded
5. **Document**: Update type documentation with any new patterns

By integrating automatic refactoring into our type safety workflow, we ensure that our codebase remains clean, consistent, and type-safe as it evolves.
