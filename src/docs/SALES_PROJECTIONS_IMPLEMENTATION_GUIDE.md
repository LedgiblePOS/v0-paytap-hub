# Sales Projections Module Implementation Guide

This document provides guidance on implementing and extending the Sales Projections module, following our established workflow pattern and best practices.

## Module Structure

The Sales Projections module follows a layered architecture:

1. **Service Layer** (`salesProjector.ts`): Core business logic for projecting sales based on historical data
2. **Hook Layer** (`useSalesProjections.ts`): React hook that interfaces between services and UI components
3. **Component Layer**: Reusable UI components specific to sales projections
4. **Page Layer**: Page component that composes other components into a full UI

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Service Layer

The `salesProjector` service handles the core business logic for projections:

```typescript
// Sales projection service responsibilities:
- Fetching historical sales data
- Calculating growth rates
- Applying seasonal adjustments
- Determining confidence levels
- Generating projections for future periods
```

### 2. Hook Layer

The `useSalesProjections` hook provides a clean interface for components:

```typescript
// Hook responsibilities:
- Managing loading and error states
- Caching projection results
- Handling projection option changes
- Calculating derived metrics from projections
```

### 3. Component Layer

Reusable components that can be composed in different ways:

```
ProjectionSettings - Configuration UI for projection parameters
ProjectionResults - Display projection charts and metrics
ComparisonChart - Compare actual vs projected sales
SeasonalityChart - Visualize seasonal factors
```

### 4. Page Layer

The main page component that integrates all parts:

```typescript
// Page responsibilities:
- Page layout and structure
- Tab navigation between different projection views
- Context-specific actions
```

## Key Best Practices

### 1. Type Safety

- Define clear interfaces for all data structures
- Use TypeScript's discriminated unions for state management
- Properly type function parameters and return values
- Use generic types for reusable components

### 2. Error Handling

- Implement appropriate error boundaries
- Handle loading, error, and empty states gracefully
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed errors for debugging

### 3. Testing Strategy

- Unit test each layer independently
- Mock dependencies for isolation
- Test both success and error paths
- Create specific test cases for edge conditions

### 4. Responsive Design

- Design mobile-first interfaces
- Use responsive Tailwind utilities
- Test on multiple viewport sizes
- Handle touch interactions appropriately

## Extension Points

### 1. Enhanced Projection Algorithms

Future enhancements can include:

- Machine learning-based predictions
- Multiple projection models (pessimistic, realistic, optimistic)
- Integration with external economic indicators
- Incorporation of market trends

### 2. Additional Visualization Options

Extend the module with:

- Comparison charts with historical data
- Breakdown by product category
- Cash flow projections
- What-if scenario modeling

### 3. Data Export Capabilities

Add capabilities for:

- CSV/Excel export of projections
- PDF report generation
- Automated projection reports via email
- Integration with accounting software

## Implementation Checklist

When implementing new features for the Sales Projections module:

- [ ] Update service layer with new business logic
- [ ] Extend hooks to expose new functionality
- [ ] Add new UI components or enhance existing ones
- [ ] Update page component to incorporate new features
- [ ] Add tests for all new functionality
- [ ] Update documentation with new capabilities
- [ ] Ensure responsive design across devices

By following this guide, you'll maintain consistency with our established workflow patterns and best practices while extending the Sales Projections module.
