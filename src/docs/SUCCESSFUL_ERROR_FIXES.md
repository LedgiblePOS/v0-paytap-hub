# Successful Error Fixes

This document records successful fixes for common errors encountered in the application.

## Router Nesting Fix

**Problem:** 
```
Error: You cannot render a <Router> inside another <Router>. You should never have more than one in your app.
```

**Root Cause:**
The application had multiple Router components - one in `main.tsx` and another in `App.tsx`.

**Fix:**
Removed the redundant Router from `App.tsx` while keeping it in `main.tsx`.

```tsx
// Before (App.tsx)
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <ThemeProvider>
        <AuthProvider>
          <AppRoutes />
          <Toaster />
        </AuthProvider>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </Router>
  );
}

// After (App.tsx)
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <AuthProvider>
        <AppRoutes />
        <Toaster />
      </AuthProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

// main.tsx - kept as is with the Router
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Router>
      <App />
    </Router>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

## Import Naming Conflicts

**Problem:**
```
error TS2395: Individual declarations in merged declaration 'X' must be all exported or all local.
```

**Root Cause:** 
Importing a function with the same name as a function being defined in the current file.

**Fix:**
Used import aliasing to avoid naming conflicts.

```typescript
// Before
import { getUserData } from './authApi';
export const getUserData = async () => { /* ... */ };

// After
import { getUserData as fetchUserData } from './authApi';
export const getUserData = async () => { /* ... */ };
```

## Blank Screen Detection

**Problem:**
Application occasionally showing blank screens with no error messages.

**Root Cause:**
Content loading states were not properly tracked, or error boundaries not correctly implemented.

**Fix:**
Added content detection attributes and loading state handling.

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Set data attributes for content detection
  const container = document.querySelector('main');
  if (container) {
    container.setAttribute('data-content-ready', 'true');
  }
  
  // Mark root as having content
  const root = document.getElementById('root');
  if (root) {
    root.setAttribute('data-has-content', 'true');
  }
}, []);
```

## POS Wholesale Discount Feature

**Problem:**
The POS system needed to support wholesale discounts for certain customer types.

**Implementation:**
- Created discount utility functions to handle various discount types (percentage, fixed amount)
- Added a customer selection feature to choose retail or wholesale customers
- Implemented automatic wholesale pricing for eligible customers
- Updated the cart to display original price and discounted price
- Modified checkout to show discount information in the order summary

**Key Features Added:**
- Customer type selection (retail vs wholesale)
- Automatic discount application based on customer type
- Manual discount controls for percentage or fixed amount discounts
- Visual indicators for discounted items
- Discount summary in checkout

## Best Practices to Prevent Errors

1. **Router Configuration**
   - Only use one Router component in the entire application
   - Keep the Router in the top-level component (main.tsx)

2. **Import Naming**
   - Use import aliases when importing items with names that might conflict
   - Keep consistent naming conventions across the application

3. **Content Detection**
   - Add data attributes to mark when content is ready
   - Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
   - Use console logs strategically for debugging
