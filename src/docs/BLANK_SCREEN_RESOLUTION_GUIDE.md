# Blank Screen Resolution Guide

This document tracks our progress in resolving blank/white screen issues across the application.

## Current Status

- **Dashboard**: Functioning properly
- **Inventory**: In progress - addressing blank screen issues
- **Accounting**: Pending review
- **Customers**: Pending review
- **POS**: Pending review
- **Settings**: Pending review

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Race Conditions**: Components attempting to access data before it's available
2. **Missing Error Boundaries**: Errors not being properly caught and handled
3. **Incomplete Page Implementations**: Pages without proper loading or empty states
4. **Timing Issues**: Loading state transitions happening too quickly or not at all
5. **Component Mounting/Unmounting Problems**: Issues with component lifecycle
6. **Missing Content Detection**: No mechanism to detect if actual content is rendering
7. **Build Errors**: Syntax errors (like the BanknotesIcon vs BanknoteIcon issue)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced BlankScreenRecovery Component

- Improved content detection with multiple checks
- Added progressive retry mechanism (3 attempts before showing error)
- Added debug mode for better troubleshooting
- Made error messages more specific to current route

### 2. Improved PageContainer Component

- Added explicit logging for component lifecycle
- Implemented safety timeouts to prevent infinite loading
- Added data attributes for easier testing and content detection
- Ensured smooth transitions between loading and content states

### 3. Documentation

- Created this tracking document to monitor progress
- Added comments to key components explaining their role in preventing blank screens

## Current Focus: Inventory Module

We're currently focusing on the Inventory module to resolve blank screen issues. The approach is:

1. Fix any build errors (like the BanknoteIcon issue)
2. Enhance the BlankScreenRecovery component for better detection
3. Improve the PageContainer component for more robust rendering
4. Test the Inventory module thoroughly
5. Apply lessons learned to other modules

## Next Steps

- Complete the Inventory module fixes
- Test all routes in the Inventory module
- Document specific fixes that resolved the issues
- Apply the successful patterns to remaining modules

## Testing Checklist for Each Module

- Initial load from different routes
- Refresh while on the page
- Navigate to the page from other pages
- Test with network throttling
- Test with cache cleared

## Module-Specific Notes

### Inventory Module

- Investigating potential data loading issues
- Added additional logging to track component lifecycle
- Implemented more robust error handling
